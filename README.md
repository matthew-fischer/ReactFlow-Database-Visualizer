# React Application

- This is a react project I made that has a similar visual representation to what I built as a Software Developer for the Government of Canada.
- The functionality and how the databases are read/created are not the same. During my internship I created a backend server to store database information.
- Here I am using static JSON files to store database information.
- I built this project to have more practice with React.js and with the ReactFlow library.
